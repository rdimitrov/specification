# Introduction # {#introduction}

## Scope ## {#scope}

This document describes a framework for securing software update systems.

The keywords "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD,"
"SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Motivation ## {#motivation}

Software is commonly updated through <dfn id="update-system">software update
systems</dfn>. These systems can be package managers that are responsible for
all of the software that is installed on a system, application updaters that
are only responsible for individual installed applications, or software
library managers that install software that adds functionality such as plugins
or programming language libraries.

The <a href="#repository">repository</a> side of such systems is responsible
for distributing <a href="#target-file">content</a> and its related
<a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> and the <a href="#client">client</a>
side handles the process for fetching and verifying that content.

<dfn id="client">Client</dfn> side implementations of <a href="#update-system">
software update systems</a> all have the common behavior of downloading files
that identify whether updates exist and, when updates do exist, downloading the
files that are required for the update. For the implementations concerned with
security, various integrity and authenticity checks are performed on downloaded
files.

<a href="#update-system">Software update systems</a> are vulnerable to a
variety of known attacks. This is generally true even for implementations
that have tried to be secure.

## History and credit ## {#history-and-credit}

Work on TUF began in late 2009.  The core ideas are based off of previous
work done by Justin Cappos and Justin Samuel that [identified security flaws
in all popular Linux package managers](https://theupdateframework.io/papers/attacks-on-package-managers-ccs2008.pdf).
More information and current versions of this document can be found at
[https://theupdateframework.io/](https://theupdateframework.io/)

The [Global Environment for Network Innovations](https://www.geni.net/) (GENI)
and the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) (NSF) have
provided support for the development of TUF.

TUF's reference implementation is based on prior work on
[Thandy](https://www.torproject.org/), the application
updater for Tor. Its design and this spec
also came from ideas jointly developed in discussion with Thandy's authors.
The Thandy spec can be found at
[https://gitweb.torproject.org/thandy.git/tree/specs/thandy-spec.txt
](https://gitweb.torproject.org/thandy.git/tree/specs/thandy-spec.txt)

Whereas Thandy is an application updater for an individual software project,
TUF aims to provide a way to secure any
<a href="#update-system">software update system</a>. We're very
grateful to the Tor Project and the Thandy developers for the early discussion
that led to the ideas in Thandy and TUF. Thandy is the hard
work of Nick Mathewson, Sebastian Hahn, Roger Dingledine, Martin Peck, and
others.

## Non-goals ## {#non-goals}

We are not creating a universal <a href="#update-system">update system</a>,
but rather a simple and flexible way that <a href="#client">applications</a>
can have high levels of security with their software update systems. Creating
a universal software update system would not be a reasonable goal due to the
diversity of application-specific functionality in software update systems
and the limited usefulness that such a system would have for securing legacy
software update systems.

We won't be defining package formats or even performing the actual update
of application files. We will provide the simplest mechanism possible that
remains easy to use and provides a secure way for <a href="#client">client
applications</a> to obtain and verify files being distributed by trusted
parties.

We are not providing a means to bootstrap security so that arbitrary
installation of new software is secure.  In practice this means that people
still need to use other means to verify the integrity and authenticity of
files they download manually.

The framework will not have the responsibility of deciding on the correct
course of action in all error situations, such as those that can occur when
certain attacks are being performed. Instead, the framework will provide
the <a href="#update-system">software update system</a> the relevant
information about any errors that require security decisions which are
situation-specific. How those errors are handled is up to the software
update system.

## Goals ## {#goals}

We need to provide a framework (a set of libraries, file formats, and
utilities) that can be used to secure new and existing <a href="#update-system">
software update systems</a>.

The framework should enable <a href="#client">applications</a> to be secure
from all known attacks on the software update process. It is not concerned
with exposing information about what software is being updated (and thus what
software the <a href="#client">client</a> may be running) or the contents of
updates.

The framework should provide means to minimize the impact of key compromise.
To do so, it must support roles with multiple keys and threshold/quorum
trust (with the exception of minimally trusted roles designed to use a
single key).  The compromise of roles using highly vulnerable keys should
have minimal impact.  Therefore, online keys (keys which are used in an
automated fashion) must not be used for any role that clients ultimately
trust for files they may install.

The framework must be flexible enough to meet the needs of a wide variety of
<a href="#update-system">software update systems</a>.

The framework must be easy to integrate with <a href="#update-system">software
update systems</a>.

### Goals for implementation ### {#goals-for-implementation}

+ The framework addresses both parts of the <a href="#update-system">software
  update system</a> - the <a href="#repository">repository</a> side and the
  <a href="#client">client</a> side.

+ The <a href="#client">client</a> side of the framework must be
  straightforward to implement in any programming language and for any
  platform with the requisite networking and crypto support.

+ The process by which developers push updates to the <a href="#repository">
  repository</a> must be simple.

+ The framework must be secure to use in environments that lack support for
  SSL (TLS).  This does not exclude the optional use of SSL when available,
  but the framework will be designed without it.

### Goals to protect against specific attacks ### {#goals-to-protect-against-specific-attacks}

Note: When saying the framework protects against an attack, it means the
attack will be unsuccessful. It does not mean that a <a href="#client">client</a>
will always successfully update during an attack. Fundamentally, an attacker
positioned to intercept and modify a client's communication can always perform
a denial of service. Nevertheless, the framework must detect when a client is
unable to update.

+ **Arbitrary installation attacks.** An attacker cannot install anything
  they want on the <a href="#client">client</a> system. That is,
  an attacker cannot provide arbitrary files in response to download requests.

+ **Endless data attacks.** An attacker cannot respond to <a href="#client">
  client</a> requests with huge amounts of data (extremely large files) that
  interfere with the client's system.

+ **Extraneous dependencies attacks.** An attacker cannot cause <a href="#client">
  clients</a> to download or install software dependencies that are not the
  intended dependencies.

+ **Fast-forward attacks.** An attacker cannot arbitrarily increase the
  version numbers of <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> files, listed in the
  snapshot metadata, well beyond the current value and thus tricking a
  <a href="#update-system">software update system</a> into thinking any subsequent
  updates are trying to rollback the package to a previous, out-of-date version.
  In some situations, such as those where there is a maximum possible version
  number, the perpetrator cannot use a number so high that the system would never
  be able to match it with the one in the snapshot metadata, and thus new updates
  could never be downloaded.

+ **Indefinite freeze attacks.** An attacker cannot respond to <a href="#client">
  client</a> requests with the same, outdated <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
  without the client being aware of the problem.

+ **Malicious mirrors preventing updates.** A <a href="#repository">repository</a>
  mirror cannot prevent updates from good mirrors.

+ **Mix-and-match attacks.** An attacker cannot trick <a href="#client">clients</a>
  into using a combination of <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> that never
  existed together on the <a href="#repository">repository</a> at the same time.

+ **Rollback attacks.** An attacker cannot trick <a href="#client">clients</a>
  into installing software that is older than that which the client previously
  knew to be available.

+ **Vulnerability to key compromises.** An attacker, who is able to
  compromise a single key or less than a given threshold of keys, cannot
  compromise <a href="#client">clients</a>. This includes compromising
  a single online key (such as only being protected by SSL) or a single
  offline key (such as most <a href="#update-system">software update systems</a>
  use to sign files).

+ **Wrong software installation.** An attacker cannot provide a file
  (trusted or untrusted) that is not the one the <a href="#client">client</a>
  wanted.

### Goals for PKI ### {#goals-for-pki}

+ <a href="#update-system">Software update systems</a> using the framework's
  <a href="#client">client</a> code interface should never have to
  directly manage keys.

* All keys must be easily and safely revocable.  Trusting new keys for a role
  must be easy.

* For roles where trust delegation is meaningful, a role should be able to
  delegate full or limited trust to another role.

* The root of trust must not rely on external PKI.  That is, no authority will
  be derived from keys outside of the framework.

### TUF Augmentation Proposal (TAP) support ### {#tuf-augmentation-proposal-tap-support}

This major version (1.x.y) of the specification adheres to the following TAPS:

- [TAP 6](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap6.md):
    Include specification version in metadata
- [TAP 9](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap9.md):
    Mandatory Metadata signing schemes
- [Tap 10](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap10.md):
    Remove native support for compressed metadata
- [TAP 11](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap11.md):
    Using POUFs for Interoperability

Implementations compliant with this major version (1.x.y) of the specification
must also comply with the TAPs mentioned above.

# System overview # {#system-overview}

The framework ultimately provides a secure method of obtaining trusted
files. To avoid ambiguity, we will refer to the files the framework is used
to distribute as "<dfn id="target-file">target files</dfn>". Target files
are opaque to the framework. Whether target files are packages containing
multiple files, single text files, or executable binaries is irrelevant to
the framework.

The <dfn id="target-metadata">metadata</dfn> describing target files is the
information necessary to securely identify the file and indicate which roles
are trusted to provide the file. As providing additional information about
target files may be important to some <a href="#update-system">software update
systems</a> using the framework, additional arbitrary information can be
provided with any target file. This information will be included in signed
metadata that describes the target files.

The following are the high-level steps of using the framework from the
viewpoint of a <a href="#update-system">software update system</a>
using the framework. This is an error-free case.

  : Polling
  ::
    Periodically, the <a href="#update-system">software update system</a>
    using the framework instructs the framework to check each
    <a href="#repository">repository</a> for updates. If the framework
    reports to the <a href="#client">application</a> code that there
    are updates, the application code determines whether it wants to download
    the updated <a href="#target-file">target files</a>. Only target files
    that are trusted (referenced by properly signed and timely
    <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>) are made available by the framework.

  : Fetching
  ::
    For each file that the <a href="#client">application</a> wants,
    it asks the framework to download the <a href="#target-file">file</a>.
    The framework downloads the file and performs security checks to ensure that
    the downloaded file is exactly what is expected according to the signed
    <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>. The application code is not given
    access to the file until the security checks have been completed. The
    application asks the framework to copy the downloaded file to a location
    specified by the application. At this point, the application has securely
    obtained the target file and can do with it whatever it wishes.

## Roles and PKI ## {#roles-and-pki}

In the discussion of roles that follows, it is important to remember that
the framework has been designed to allow a large amount of flexibility for
many different use cases.  For example, it is possible to use the framework
with a single key that is the only key used in the entire system.  This is
considered to be insecure but the flexibility is provided in order to meet
the needs of diverse use cases.

There are four fundamental top-level roles in the framework:
- Root role
- Targets role
- Snapshot role
- Timestamp role

There is also one optional top-level role:
- Mirrors role

All roles can use one or more keys and require a threshold of signatures of
the role's keys in order to trust a given <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
file.

### Root role ### {#root}

The root role delegates trust to specific keys trusted for all other
top-level roles used in the system.

The <a href="#client">client side</a> of the framework MUST ship
with trusted root keys for each configured <a href="#repository">repository</a>.

The root role's private keys MUST be kept very secure and thus should be
kept offline. If less than a threshold of Root keys are compromised, the
<a href="#repository">repository</a> should revoke trust on the compromised keys.
This can be accomplished with a normal rotation of root keys, covered in section
[[#key-management-and-migration]]. If a threshold of root keys is compromised,
the Root keys should be updated out-of-band, however, the threshold should
be chosen so that this is extremely unlikely.  In the unfortunate event that
a threshold of keys are compromised, it is safest to assume that attackers
have installed malware and taken over affected machines.  For this reason,
making it difficult for attackers to compromise all of the offline keys is
important because safely recovering from it is nearly impossible.


### Targets role ### {#targets}

The targets role's signature indicates which <a href="#target-file">target files</a>
are trusted by <a href="#client">clients</a>. The targets role signs
<a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> that describes these files,
not the actual target files themselves.

In addition, the targets role can delegate full or partial trust to other
roles.  Delegating trust means that the targets role indicates another role
(that is, another set of keys and the threshold required for trust) is
trusted to sign target file <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>. Partial
trust delegation is when the delegated role is only trusted for some of the
target files that the delegating role is trusted for.

Delegated roles can further delegate trust to other delegated
roles.  This provides for multiple levels of trust delegation where each
role can delegate full or partial trust for the target files they are
trusted for.  The delegating role in these cases is still trusted.  That is,
a role does not become untrusted when it has delegated trust.

Any delegation can be revoked at any time: the delegating role needs only
to sign new <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> that no longer contains
that delegation.

### Snapshot role ### {#snapshot}

The snapshot role signs a <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file that
provides information about the latest version of all targets metadata on the
<a href="#repository">repository</a> (the top-level targets role and all
delegated roles). This information allows <a href="#client">clients</a> to
know which metadata files have been updated and also prevents mix-and-match
attacks.

### Timestamp role ### {#timestamp}

To prevent an adversary from replaying an out-of-date signed
<a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file whose signature has not yet
expired, an automated process periodically signs a timestamped statement
containing the hash of the snapshot file. Even though this timestamp key
must be kept online, the risk posed to <a href="#client">clients</a> by
the compromise of this key is minimal.

### Mirrors role ### {#mirrors}

Every <a href="#repository">repository</a> has one or more mirrors from
which <a href="#target-file">target files</a> can be downloaded by
<a href="#client">clients</a>. A <a href="#update-system">software update
system</a> using the framework may choose to hard-code the mirror
information in their software or they may choose to use mirror
<a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> files that can optionally be
signed by a mirrors role.

The importance of using signed mirror lists depends on the
<a href="#client">application</a> and the users of that application.
There is minimal risk to the application's security from being tricked into
contacting the wrong mirrors. This is because the framework has very little
trust in <a href="#repository">repositories</a>.

## Threat model and analysis ## {#threat-model-and-analysis}

We assume an adversary who can respond to <a href="#client">client</a>
requests, whether by acting as a man-in-the-middle or through compromising
<a href="#repository">repository</a> mirrors. At worst, such an adversary
can deny updates to users if no good mirrors are accessible. An inability to
obtain updates is noticed by the framework.

If an adversary compromises enough keys to sign <a href="#target-metadata">
metadata</a>, the best that can be done is to limit the number of users who
are affected. The level to which this threat is mitigated is dependent on
how the <a href="#client">application</a> is using the framework. This
includes whether different keys have been used for different signing roles.

A detailed threat analysis is outside the scope of this document. This is
partly because the specific threat posted to <a href="#client">clients</a>
in many situations is largely determined by how the framework is being used.

## Protocol, Operations, Usage, and Format (POUF) documents ## {#pouf-documents}

This specification purposefully leaves many implementation details,
including the <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file formats, to the
discretion of individual implementations. These details do not affect the
security of an implementation, and so leaving them out of the specification
allows this document to support a greater variety of users. TUF implementers are
encouraged to document the wireline format and design decisions used in
their implementation as a POUF document. POUFs, as described in
[TAP 11](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap11.md),
allow different adopters to create interoperable implementations of TUF.
POUFs should follow the layout described in TAP 11 and may be made
publicly available in the [TAP directory](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/tree/master/POUFs).

# The repository # {#the-repository}

An <a href="#client">application</a> uses the framework to interact with
one or more repositories. A <dfn id="repository">repository</dfn> is a
conceptual source of <a href="#target-file">target files</a> of interest
to the application. Each <a href="#repository">repository</a> has one or
more mirrors which are the actual providers of files to be downloaded.
For example, each mirror may specify a different host where files can be
downloaded from over HTTP.

The mirrors can be full or partial mirrors as long as the <a href="#client">
application</a> side of the framework can ultimately obtain all of the files
it needs. A mirror is a partial mirror if it is missing files that a full
mirror should have. If a mirror is intended to only act as a partial mirror,
the <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> and target paths available from
that mirror can be specified.

Roles, trusted keys, and target files are completely separate between
repositories.  A multi-repository setup is a multi-root system.  When an
application uses the framework with multiple repositories, the framework
does not perform any "mixing" of the trusted content from each
<a href="#repository">repository</a>. It is up to the application to
determine the significance of the same or different target files provided
from separate repositories.

## Repository layout ## {#repository-layout}

The filesystem layout in the <a href="#repository">repository</a> is
used for two purposes:

- To give mirrors an easy way to mirror only some of the
  <a href="#repository">repository</a>.
- To specify which parts of the <a href="#repository">repository</a> a
  given role has authority to sign/provide.

### Target files ### {#target-files}

The filenames and the directory structure of <a href="#target-file">
target files</a> available from a <a href="#repository">repository</a> are
not specified by the framework. The names of these files and directories
are completely at the discretion of the <a href="#client">application</a>
using the framework.

### Metadata files ### {#metadata-files}

The filenames and directory structure of <a href="#repository">repository</a>
<a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> are strictly defined. All metadata
filenames will have an extension (EXT) based on the metaformat, for example
JSON metadata files would have an EXT of json. The following are the metadata
files of top-level roles relative to the base URL of metadata available from
a given <a href="#repository">repository</a> mirror.

  : /root.EXT
  ::
    Signed by the root keys; specifies trusted keys for the other
    top-level roles.

  : /snapshot.EXT
  ::
    Signed by the snapshot role's keys. Lists the version numbers of all
    target <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> files: the top-level
    targets.EXT and all delegated roles.

  : /targets.EXT
  ::
    Signed by the target role's keys. Lists hashes and sizes of <a href="#target-file">
    target files</a>. Specifies delegation information and trusted keys for
    delegated target roles.

  : /timestamp.EXT
  ::
    Signed by the timestamp role's keys. Lists hash(es), size, and version
    number of the snapshot file. This is the first and potentially only
    file that needs to be downloaded when <a href="#client">clients</a>
    poll for the existence of updates.

  : /mirrors.EXT (optional)
  ::
    Signed by the mirrors role's keys. Lists information about available
    mirrors and the <a href="#target-file">content</a> available from each mirror.

#### Metadata files for targets delegation #### {#metadata-files-for-targets-delegation}

When the targets role delegates trust to other roles, each delegated role
provides one signed <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file. As is the case
with the directory structure of top-level metadata, the delegated files are relative
to the base URL of metadata available from a given <a href="#repository">repository</a>
mirror.

A delegated role file is located at:

  : /DELEGATED_ROLE.EXT
  ::
    Where DELEGATED_ROLE is the name of the delegated role that has been
    specified in targets.EXT. If this role further delegates trust to a role
    named ANOTHER_ROLE, that role's signed <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
    file is made available at:

  : /ANOTHER_ROLE.EXT
  ::
    Delegated target roles are authorized by the keys listed in the directly
    delegating target role.

# Document formats # {#document-formats}

All of the formats described below include the ability to add more
attribute-value fields to objects for backwards-compatible format changes.
Implementers who encounter undefined attribute-value pairs in the format
must include the data when calculating hashes or verifying signatures and must
preserve the data when re-serializing. If a backwards incompatible format change
is needed, a new filename can be used.

## Metaformat ## {#metaformat}

Implementers of TUF may use any data format for <a href="#target-metadata">
metadata</a> files as long as all fields in this specification are included
and TUF <a href="#client">clients</a> are able to interpret them without
ambiguity. Implementers should choose a data format that allows for
canonicalization, or one that will decode data deterministically by default so
that signatures can be accurately verified. The chosen data format should be
documented in the POUF of the implementation. The examples in this document use
a subset of the JSON object format, with floating-point numbers omitted. When
calculating the digest of an object, we use the "canonical JSON" subdialect
as described at [Canonical JSON](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Canonical_JSON).

## File formats: general principles ## {#file-formats-general-principles}

All signed <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> objects have the format:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "signed" : <a for="role">ROLE</a>,
  "signatures" : [
    { "keyid" : <a for="role">KEYID</a>,
      "sig" : <a>SIGNATURE</a> }
      , ... ]
}
</pre>

      : <dfn for="role">ROLE</dfn>
      ::
        A dictionary whose "_type" field describes the role type.

      : <dfn for="role">KEYID</dfn>
      ::
        The identifier of the key signing the <a for="role">ROLE</a> object,
        which is a hexdigest of the SHA-256 hash of the canonical form of the key.
        The keyid MUST be unique in the "signatures" array: multiple
        signatures with the same keyid are not allowed.

      : <dfn>SIGNATURE</dfn>
      ::
        A hex-encoded signature of the canonical form of the <a href="#target-metadata">
        metadata</a> for <a for="role">ROLE</a>.


All <dfn>KEY</dfn>s have the format:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "keytype" : <a>KEYTYPE</a>,
  "scheme" : <a>SCHEME</a>,
  "keyval" : <a>KEYVAL</a>
}
</pre>

      : <dfn>KEYTYPE</dfn>
      ::
        A string denoting a public key signature system, such as <a
        for="keytype">"rsa"</a>, <a for="keytype">"ed25519"</a>, and <a
        for="keytype">"ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"</a>.

      : <dfn>SCHEME</dfn>
      ::
        A string denoting a corresponding signature scheme.  For example: <a
        for="scheme">"rsassa-pss-sha256"</a>, <a for="scheme">"ed25519"</a>, and <a
        for="scheme">"ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"</a>.

      : <dfn>KEYVAL</dfn>
      ::
        A dictionary containing the public portion of the key.

The reference implementation defines three signature schemes, although TUF
is not restricted to any particular signature scheme, key type, or
cryptographic library:

  : <dfn for="scheme">"rsassa-pss-sha256"</dfn>
  ::
    RSA Probabilistic signature scheme with appendix. The underlying hash
    function is SHA256. [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#page-29
    ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#page-29)

  : <dfn for="scheme">"ed25519"</dfn>
  ::
    Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm based on Twisted Edwards curves.
    [https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)

  : <dfn for="scheme">"ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"</dfn>
  ::
    Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with NIST P-256 curve signing
    and SHA-256 hashing.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)

We define three keytypes below: <a for="keytype">"rsa"</a>, <a
for="keytype">"ed25519"</a>, and <a for="keytype">"ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"</a>, but
adopters can define and use any particular keytype, signing scheme, and cryptographic
library.

The <dfn for="keytype">"rsa"</dfn> format is:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "keytype" : <a for="keytype">"rsa"</a>,
  "scheme" : <a for="scheme">"rsassa-pss-sha256"</a>,
  "keyval" : {
    "public" : <a for="keyval-rsa">PUBLIC</a>
  }
}
</pre>

  : <dfn for="keyval-rsa">PUBLIC</dfn>
  ::
    PEM format and a string.  All RSA keys MUST be at least 2048 bits.

The <dfn for="keytype">"ed25519"</dfn> format is:

Metadata <dfn>date-time</dfn> follows the ISO 8601 standard.  The expected
format of the combined date and time string is "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ".  Time is
always in UTC, and the "Z" time zone designator is attached to indicate a
zero UTC offset.  An example <a>date-time</a> string is "1985-10-21T01:21:00Z".


## File formats: root.json ## {#file-formats-root}

The <dfn>root.json</dfn> file is signed by the root role's keys.  It indicates
which keys are authorized for all top-level roles, including the root
role itself.  Revocation and replacement of top-level role keys, including
for the root role, is done by changing the keys listed for the roles in
this file.

The "signed" portion of <a>root.json</a> is as follows:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "_type" : "root",
  "spec_version" : <a>SPEC_VERSION</a>,
  "consistent_snapshot": <a>CONSISTENT_SNAPSHOT</a>,
  "version" : <a for="role">VERSION</a>,

      "threshold" : <a>THRESHOLD</a>
    },
    ...
  }
}
</pre>

  : <dfn>SPEC_VERSION</dfn>
  ::
    A string that contains the version number of the TUF
    specification. Its format follows the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
    (semver)](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) specification. Metadata is
    written according to version "spec_version" of the specification, and
    clients MUST verify that "spec_version" matches the expected version number.
    Adopters are free to determine what is considered a match (e.g., the version
    number exactly, or perhaps only the major version number (major.minor.fix).

  : <dfn>CONSISTENT_SNAPSHOT</dfn>
  ::
    An OPTIONAL boolean indicating whether the <a href="#repository">repository</a> supports
    consistent snapshots. This field is OPTIONAL for backwards compatibility with
    old metadata. New implementations SHOULD include it. Section
    [[#consistent-snapshots]] goes into more detail on the consequences of
    enabling this setting on a <a href="#repository">repository</a>.

  : <dfn for="role">VERSION</dfn>
  ::
    An integer that is greater than 0. <a href="#client">Clients</a> MUST NOT
    replace a <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file with a version number
    less than the one currently trusted.

  : <dfn>EXPIRES</dfn>
  ::
    A <a>date-time</a> string indicating when <a href="#target-metadata">
    metadata</a> should be considered expired and no longer trusted by
    <a href="#client">clients</a>. Clients MUST NOT trust an expired file.

  : <dfn for="root">ROLE</dfn>
  ::
    One of "root", "snapshot", "targets", "timestamp", or "mirrors".
    A role for each of "root", "snapshot", "timestamp", and "targets" MUST be
    specified in the roles object. The role of "mirror" is OPTIONAL. If not
    specified, the mirror list will not need to be signed if mirror lists are
    being used.

  : <dfn for="root">KEYID</dfn>
  ::
    A <a for="role">KEYID</a>, which MUST be correct for the specified KEY.
    <a href="#client">Clients</a> MUST calculate each <a for="role">KEYID</a>
    to verify this is correct for the associated key. Clients MUST ensure that
    for any <a for="role">KEYID</a> represented in this key list and in other files,
    only one unique key has that <a for="role">KEYID</a>.

  : <dfn>THRESHOLD</dfn>
  ::
    An integer number of keys of that role whose signatures are required in
    order to consider a file as being properly signed by that role.

## File formats: snapshot.json ## {#file-formats-snapshot}

The <dfn>snapshot.json</dfn> file is signed by the snapshot role. It MUST list the
version numbers of the top-level targets <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
and all delegated targets metadata. It MAY also list their lengths and file hashes.

The "signed" portion of <a>snapshot.json</a> is as follows:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "_type" : "snapshot",
  "spec_version" : <a>SPEC_VERSION</a>,
  "version" : <a for="role">VERSION</a>,
  "expires" : <a>EXPIRES</a>,
  "meta" : <a>METAFILES</a>
}
</pre>

<a>SPEC_VERSION</a>, <a for="role">VERSION</a> and <a>EXPIRES</a> are the same
as is described for the <a>root.json</a> file.

<dfn>METAFILES</dfn> is an object whose format is the following:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  <a for="snapshot">METAPATH</a> : {
    "version" : <a for="metapath">VERSION</a>,

  },
  ...
}
</pre>

  : <dfn for="snapshot">METAPATH</dfn>
  ::
    A string giving the file path of the metadata on the
    <a href="#repository">repository</a> relative to the metadata base URL.
    For <a>snapshot.json</a>, these are top-level targets metadata and delegated
    targets metadata.

  : <dfn for="metapath">VERSION</dfn>
  ::
    An integer version number as shown in the metadata file at
    <a for="snapshot">METAPATH</a>.

  : <dfn for="metapath">LENGTH</dfn>
  ::
    An integer length in bytes of the metadata file at
    <a for="snapshot">METAPATH</a>. It is OPTIONAL and can be omitted to reduce
    the snapshot metadata file size. In that case the <a href="#client">client</a>
    MUST use a custom download limit for the listed metadata.

  : <dfn for="metapath">HASHES</dfn>
  ::
    A dictionary that specifies one or more hashes of the metadata
    file at <a for="snapshot">METAPATH</a>, with the cryptographic hash
    function as key and the value as <dfn>HASH</dfn>, the hexdigest of the
    cryptographic function computed on the metadata file at
    <a for="snapshot">METAPATH</a>. For example: `{ "sha256": HASH, ... }`.
    <a for="metapath">HASHES</a> is OPTIONAL and can be omitted to reduce the
    snapshot metadata file size. In that case the <a href="#repository">repository</a>

## File formats: targets.json and delegated target roles ## {#file-formats-targets}

The "signed" portion of <dfn>targets.json</dfn> is as follows:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "_type" : "targets",
  "spec_version" : <a>SPEC_VERSION</a>,
  "version" : <a for="role">VERSION</a>,
  "expires" : <a>EXPIRES</a>,
  "targets" : <a>TARGETS</a>,
  ("delegations" : <a>DELEGATIONS</a>)
}
</pre>

<a>SPEC_VERSION</a>, <a for="role">VERSION</a> and <a>EXPIRES</a> are the same
as is described for the <a>root.json</a> file.

<dfn for="targets-obj">TARGETS</dfn> is an object whose format is the following:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  <a>TARGETPATH</a> : {
      "length" : <a for="targets-obj">LENGTH</a>,
      "hashes" : <a for="targets-obj">HASHES</a>,
      ("custom" : <a>CUSTOM</a>) }
  , ...
}
</pre>

  : <a for="targets-obj">TARGETS</a>
  ::
    Each key of the <a for="targets-obj">TARGETS</a> object is a <a>TARGETPATH</a>.

  : <dfn>TARGETPATH</dfn>
  ::
    A string giving the path to a file that is relative to a mirror's base URL
    of targets.  To avoid surprising behavior when resolving paths, it is
    RECOMMENDED that a <a>TARGETPATH</a> uses the forward slash (/) as directory
    separator and does not start with a directory separator. The recommendation
    for <a>TARGETPATH</a> aligns with the ["path-relative-URL string"
    definition](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#path-relative-url-string) in the
    WHATWG URL specification.

    It is allowed to have a <a>TARGETS</a> object with no <a>TARGETPATH</a>
    elements.  This can be used to indicate that no <a href="#target-file">
    target files</a> are available.

  : <dfn for="targets-obj">LENGTH</dfn>
  ::
    An integer length in bytes of the target file at <a>TARGETPATH</a>.

  : <dfn for="targets-obj">HASHES</dfn>
  ::
    A dictionary that specifies one or more hashes of the <a href="#target-file">
    target file</a> at <a>TARGETPATH</a>, with a string describing the
    cryptographic hash function as key and <a>HASH</a> as defined for
    <a>METAFILES</a>. For example:
    `{ "sha256": HASH, ... }`.

  : <dfn>CUSTOM</a>
  ::
    An object. If defined, the elements and values of the <a>CUSTOM</a> object
    will be made available to the <a href="#client">client</a> application.
    The format of the <a>CUSTOM</a> object is opaque to the framework, which only
    needs to know that the "custom" attribute maps to an object. The <a>CUSTOM</a>
    object may include version numbers, dependencies, requirements, or any other data
    that the application wants to include to describe the file at
    <a>TARGETPATH</a>. The application may use this information to guide download
    decisions.

<dfn>DELEGATIONS</dfn> is an OPTIONAL object and if defined it has the following
format:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "keys" : {
      <a for="role">KEYID</a> : <a>KEY</a>,
      ...
  },
  "roles" : [
    {
      "name": <a>ROLENAME</a>,
      "keyids" : [ <a for="role">KEYID</a>, ... ] ,
      "threshold" : <a>THRESHOLD</a>,
      (<a>"path_hash_prefixes"</a> : [ <a>HEX_DIGEST</a>, ... ] |
      <a for="delegation-role">"paths"</a> : [ <a>PATHPATTERN</a>, ... ]),
      "terminating": <a>TERMINATING</a>,
    },
    ...
  ]
}
</pre>

  <a for="root">KEYID</a> and <a>KEY</a> are the same as is described for the
  <a>root.json</a> file.

  : <dfn>ROLENAME</dfn>
  ::
    A string giving the name of the delegated role.  For example, "projects".
    The rolename MUST be unique in the delegations object: multiple roles with
    the same rolename are not allowed within a <a>DELEGATIONS</a>.

  : <dfn>TERMINATING</dfn>
  ::
    A boolean indicating whether subsequent delegations should be considered.

    As explained in the [Diplomat paper
    ](https://theupdateframework.io/papers/protect-community-repositories-nsdi2016.pdf),
    terminating delegations instruct the <a href="#client">client</a> not to consider
    future trust statements that match the delegation's pattern, which stops the delegation
    processing once this delegation (and its descendants) have been processed.
    A terminating delegation for a package causes any further statements about a
    package that are not made by the delegated party or its descendants to be
    ignored.

The <a>"path_hash_prefixes"</a> and <a for="delegation-role">"paths"</a>
attributes are OPTIONAL, if used, exactly one of them should be set.

  : <dfn>"path_hash_prefixes"</dfn>
  ::
    A list of <dfn>HEX_DIGEST</dfn>s used to succinctly describe a set of target
    paths. Specifically, each HEX_DIGEST in <a>"path_hash_prefixes"</a>
    describes a set of target paths; therefore, <a>"path_hash_prefixes"</a> is
    the union over each prefix of its set of target paths. The target paths
    must meet this condition: each target path, when hashed with the SHA-256
    hash function to produce a 64-byte hexadecimal digest
    (HEX_DIGEST), must share the same prefix as one of the prefixes
    in <a>"path_hash_prefixes"</a>. This is useful to split a large number of
    targets into separate bins identified by consistent hashing.

  : <dfn for="delegation-role">"paths"</dfn>
  ::
    A list of strings, where each string is a <a>PATHPATTERN</a> describing a
    path that the delegated role is trusted to provide. <a href="#client">Clients</a>
    MUST check that a <a href="#target-file">target</a> is in one of the trusted
    paths of all roles in a delegation chain, not just in a trusted path of the
    role that describes the target file.

    <dfn>PATHPATTERN</dfn> supports the Unix shell pattern matching convention
    for paths ([glob](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html)bing
    pathnames). Its format may either indicate a path to a single file, or to
    multiple files with the use of shell-style wildcards (`*` or `?`).
    To avoid surprising behavior when matching targets with <a>PATHPATTERN</a>,
    it is RECOMMENDED that <a>PATHPATTERN</a> uses the forward slash (`/`) as
    directory separator and does not start with a directory separator, as is
    also recommended for <a>TARGETPATH</a>. A path separator in a path SHOULD
    NOT be matched by a wildcard in the <a>PATHPATTERN</a>.

    Some example <a>PATHPATTERN</a>s and expected matches:
    * a <a>PATHPATTERN</a> of `"targets/*.tgz"` would match file paths
      `"targets/foo.tgz"` and `"targets/bar.tgz"`, but not `"targets/foo.txt"`.
    * a <a>PATHPATTERN</a> of `"foo-version-?.tgz"` matches
      `"foo-version-2.tgz"` and `"foo-version-a.tgz"`, but not
      `"foo-version-alpha.tgz"`.
    * a <a>PATHPATTERN</a> of `"*.tgz"` would match `"foo.tgz"` and `"bar.tgz"`,
      but not `"targets/foo.tgz"`
    * a <a>PATHPATTERN</a> of `"foo.tgz"` would match only `"foo.tgz"`

Prioritized delegations allow <a href="#client">clients</a> to resolve conflicts
between delegated roles that share responsibility for overlapping target paths. To
resolve conflicts, clients must consider <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
in order of appearance of delegations; we treat the order of delegations such that
the first delegation is trusted over the second one, the second delegation is trusted
more than the third one, and so on. Likewise, the metadata of the first delegation
will override that of the second delegation, the metadata of the second delegation
will override that of the third one, etc. In order to accommodate prioritized
delegations, the "roles" key in the <a>DELEGATIONS</a> object above points to an
array of delegated roles, rather than to a hash table.

The metadata files for delegated target roles has the same format as the
top-level <a>targets.json</a> metadata file.

## File formats: timestamp.json ## {#file-formats-timestamp}

The <dfn>timestamp.json</dfn> file is signed by the timestamp role. It indicates
the latest version of the snapshot <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> and is
frequently re-signed to limit the amount of time a <a href="#client">client</a>
can be kept unaware of interference with obtaining updates.

Timestamp files will potentially be downloaded very frequently.  Unnecessary
information in them will be avoided.

The "signed" portion of <a>timestamp.json</a> is as follows:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "_type" : "timestamp",
  "spec_version" : <a>SPEC_VERSION</a>,
  "version" : <a for="role">VERSION</a>,
  "expires" : <a>EXPIRES</a>,
  "meta" : <a>METAFILES</a>
}
</pre>

<a>SPEC_VERSION</a>, <a for="role">VERSION</a> and <a>EXPIRES</a> are the same as is
described for the <a>root.json</a> file.

<a>METAFILES</a> is the same as described for the <a>snapshot.json</a> file.  In the case
of the <a>timestamp.json</a> file, this MUST only include a description of the
<a>snapshot.json</a> file.

<div class="example" id="example-timestamp.json">

## File formats: mirrors.json ## {#file-formats-mirrors}

The <dfn>mirrors.json</dfn> file is signed by the mirrors role.  It indicates which
mirrors are active and believed to be mirroring specific parts of the
<a href="#repository">repository</a>.

The "signed" portion of <a>mirrors.json</a> is as follows:

<pre highlight="json">
{
  "_type" : "mirrors",
  "spec_version" : <a>SPEC_VERSION</a>,
  "version" : <a for="role">VERSION</a>,
  "expires" : <a>EXPIRES</a>,
  "mirrors" : [
    { "urlbase" : <a>URLBASE</a>,
      "metapath" : <a for="mirrors">METAPATH</a>,
      "targetspath" : <a>TARGETSPATH</a>,
      "metacontent" : [ <a>PATHPATTERN</a> ... ] ,
      "targetscontent" : [ <a>PATHPATTERN</a> ... ] ,
      ("custom" : { ... }) }
    , ... ]
}
</pre>

<a>SPEC_VERSION</a>, <a for="role">VERSION</a> and <a>EXPIRES</a> are the same
as is described for the <a>root.json</a> file.

  : <dfn>URLBASE</dfn>
  ::
    A string giving the URL of the mirror.

  : <dfn for="mirrors">METAPATH</dfn>
  ::
    A string giving the location from which to retrieve <a href="#target-metadata">
    metadata</a> files.
    <a for="mirrors">METAPATH</a> will be a relative path to <a>URLBASE</a>.

  : <dfn>TARGETSPATH</a>
  ::
    A string giving the location from which to retrieve <a href="#target-file">
    target files</a>.
    <a>TARGETSPATH</a> will be a relative path to <a>URLBASE</a>.

The lists of <a>PATHPATTERN</a> for "metacontent" and "targetscontent" describe the
metadata files and target files available from the mirror.

The order of the list of mirrors is important. For any file to be
downloaded, whether it is a <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file or a
<a href="#target-file">target file</a>, the framework on the <a href="#client">
client</a> will give priority to the mirrors that are listed first. That is, the
first mirror in the list whose "metacontent" or "targetscontent" include a path
that indicate the desired file can be found there will be the first mirror that
will be used to download that file. Successive mirrors with matching paths will
only be tried if downloading from earlier mirrors fails. This behavior can be
modified by the client code that uses the framework to, for example, randomly
select from the listed mirrors.

# Detailed client workflow # {#detailed-client-workflow}

Note: If a step in the following workflow does not succeed (e.g., the update
is aborted because a new <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file was not signed),
the <a href="#client">client</a> should still be able to update again in the future.
Errors raised during the update process should not leave clients in an unrecoverable state.

## Record fixed update start time ## {#fix-time}

Record the time at which the update began as the fixed update start time.
Time is fixed at the beginning of the update workflow to allow an <a href="#client">
application</a> using TUF to effectively pause time, in order to ensure that
<a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> which has a valid expiration time at the
beginning of an update does not fail an expiration check later in the update workflow.

## Load trusted root metadata ## {#load-trusted-root}

Load the trusted root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file. We assume
that a good, trusted copy of this file was shipped with the <a href="#client">package
manager or software updater</a> using an out-of-band process. Note that the
expiration of the trusted root metadata file does not matter, because we will
attempt to update it in the next step.

## Update the root role ## {#update-root}

1. Since it may now be signed using entirely different keys, the
  <a href="#client">client</a> MUST somehow be able to establish
  a trusted line of continuity to the latest set of keys (see
  [[#key-management-and-migration]]). To do so, the client MUST download
  intermediate root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> files, until
  the latest available one is reached.

2. Let N denote the version number of the trusted root <a href="#target-metadata">
  metadata</a> file.

3. **Try downloading version N+1 of the root metadata file**, up to
  some W number of bytes (because the size is unknown). The value for W is set
  by the authors of the <a href="#client">application</a> using TUF. For
  example, W may be tens of kilobytes. The filename used to download the root
  <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file is of the fixed form
  VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., 42.root.json). If this file is not available,
  or we have downloaded more than Y number of root metadata files (because the
  exact number is as yet unknown), then go to step 5.3.10. The value for Y is set
  by the authors of the application using TUF. For example, Y may be 2^10.

4. **Check for an arbitrary software attack.** Version N+1 of the root
  <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST have been signed by:
  (1) a threshold of keys specified in the trusted root metadata file
  (version N), and (2) a threshold of keys specified in the new root metadata
  file being validated (version N+1). If version N+1 is not signed as required,
  discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the signature failure. On the
  next update cycle, begin at step [[#update-root]] and version N of the root
  metadata file.

5. **Check for a rollback attack.** The version number of the trusted
  root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file (version N) MUST be less
  than or equal to the version number of the new root metadata file (version N+1).
  Effectively, this means checking that the version number signed in the new
  root metadata file is indeed N+1. If the version of the new root metadata
  file is less than the trusted metadata file, discard it, abort the update
  cycle, and report the rollback attack. On the next update cycle, begin at
  step [[#update-root]] and version N of the root metadata file.

6. Note that the expiration of the new (intermediate) root <a href="#target-metadata">
  metadata</a> file does not matter yet, because we will check for it in step 5.3.10.

7. **Set the trusted root metadata file** to the new root <a href="#target-metadata">
  metadata</a> file.

8. **Persist root metadata.** The <a href="#client">client</a> MUST write
  the file to non-volatile storage as FILENAME.EXT (e.g. root.json).

9. Repeat steps 5.3.2 to 5.3.9

10. **Check for a freeze attack.** The expiration timestamp in the
  trusted root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST be higher than
  the fixed update start time. If the trusted root metadata file has expired,
  abort the update cycle, report the potential freeze attack. On the next
  update cycle, begin at step [[#update-root]] and version N of the root
  metadata file.

11. **If the timestamp and / or snapshot keys have been rotated, then delete the
  trusted timestamp and snapshot <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> files.**
  This is done in order to recover from fast-forward attacks after the
  <a href="#repository">repository</a> has been compromised and recovered.
  A _fast-forward attack_ happens when attackers arbitrarily increase the
  version numbers of: (1) the timestamp metadata, (2) the snapshot metadata,
  and / or (3) the targets, or a delegated targets, metadata file in the
  snapshot metadata. Please see [the Mercury paper](https://theupdateframework.io/papers/prevention-rollback-attacks-atc2017.pdf)
  for more details.

12. **Set whether consistent snapshots are used as per the trusted**
  root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file (see [[#file-formats-root]]).

## Update the timestamp role ## {#update-timestamp}

1. **Download the timestamp metadata file**, up to X number of bytes
  (because the size is unknown). The value for X is set by the authors of the
  <a href="#client">application</a> using TUF. For example, X may be tens
  of kilobytes. The filename used to download the timestamp <a href="#target-metadata">
  metadata</a> file is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT (e.g., timestamp.json).

2. **Check for an arbitrary software attack.** The new timestamp
  <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST have been signed by a threshold
  of keys specified in the trusted root metadata file. If the new timestamp metadata
  file is not properly signed, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the
  signature failure.

3. **Check for a rollback attack.**

  1. The version number of the trusted timestamp <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
    file, if any, MUST be less than or equal to the version number of the new timestamp
    metadata file. If the new timestamp metadata file is older than the
    trusted timestamp metadata file, discard it, abort the update cycle, and
    report the potential rollback attack.

  2. The version number of the snapshot <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file
    in the trusted timestamp metadata file, if any, MUST be less than or equal to its
    version number in the new timestamp metadata file. If not, discard the new
    timestamp metadata file, abort the update cycle, and report the failure.

6. **Check for a freeze attack.** The expiration timestamp in the
  new timestamp <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST be higher than
  the fixed update start time. If so, the new timestamp metadata file becomes
  the trusted timestamp metadata file. If the new timestamp metadata file has
  expired, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the potential freeze attack.

7. **Persist timestamp metadata**. The <a href="#client">client</a> MUST write the file
  to non-volatile storage as FILENAME.EXT (e.g. timestamp.json).

##Â Update the snapshot role ## {#update-snapshot}

1. **Download snapshot metadata file**, up to either the number of bytes
  specified in the timestamp <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file, or some
  Y number of bytes. The value for Y is set by the authors of the application
  using TUF. For example, Y may be tens of kilobytes. If consistent snapshots are
  not used (see Section [[#consistent-snapshots]]), then the filename used to
  download the snapshot metadata file is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT (e.g.,
  snapshot.json). Otherwise, the filename is of the form
  VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., 42.snapshot.json), where VERSION_NUMBER is
  the version number of the snapshot metadata file listed in the timestamp
  metadata file.

2. **Check against timestamp role's snapshot hash**. The hashes
  of the new snapshot <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST match the
  hashes, if any, listed in the trusted timestamp metadata. This is done, in part,
  to prevent a mix-and-match attack by man-in-the-middle attackers. It is safe to
  check the hashes before the signatures, because the hashes come from the timestamp
  role, which we have already verified in the previous step; it is also a quick
  way to reject bad metadata. If the hashes do not match, discard the
  new snapshot metadata, abort the update cycle, and report the failure.

3. **Check for an arbitrary software attack**. The new snapshot
  <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST have been signed by a
  threshold of keys specified in the trusted root metadata file. If the new
  snapshot metadata file is not signed as required, discard it, abort the update
  cycle, and report the signature failure.

4. **Check against timestamp role's snapshot version**. The version
  number of the new snapshot <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST
  match the version number listed in the trusted timestamp metadata. If the
  versions do not match, discard the new snapshot metadata, abort the update
  cycle, and report the failure.

5. **Check for a rollback attack**. The version number of the targets
  <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file, and all delegated targets metadata
  files, if any, in the trusted snapshot metadata file, if any, MUST be less
  than or equal to its version number in the new snapshot metadata file.
  Furthermore, any targets metadata filename that was listed in the trusted
  snapshot metadata file, if any, MUST continue to be listed in the new snapshot
  metadata file. If any of these conditions are not met, discard the new snapshot
  metadata file, abort the update cycle, and report the failure.

6. **Check for a freeze attack**. The expiration timestamp in the
  new snapshot <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST be higher than
  the fixed update start time. If so, the new snapshot metadata file becomes
  the trusted snapshot metadata file. If the new snapshot metadata file is
  expired, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the potential freeze
  attack.

7. **Persist snapshot metadata**. The <a href="#client">client</a> MUST
  write the file to non-volatile storage as FILENAME.EXT (e.g. snapshot.json).

##Â Update the targets role ## {#update-targets}

1. **Download the top-level targets metadata file**, up to either the
  number of bytes specified in the snapshot <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
  file, or some Z number of bytes. The value for Z is set by the authors of the
  application using TUF. For example, Z may be tens of kilobytes. If consistent
  snapshots are not used (see [[#consistent-snapshots]]), then the filename used
  to download the targets metadata file is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT
  (e.g., targets.json). Otherwise, the filename is of the form
  VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., 42.targets.json), where VERSION_NUMBER is the
  version number of the targets metadata file listed in the snapshot metadata file.

2. **Check against snapshot role's targets hash**. The hashes
  of the new targets <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST match the
  hashes, if any, listed in the trusted snapshot metadata. This is done, in part,
  to prevent a mix-and-match attack by man-in-the-middle attackers. It is safe to
  check the hashes before the signatures, because the hashes come from the snapshot
  role, which we have already verified in the previous step; it is also a quick way
  to reject bad metadata. If the new targets metadata file does not match, discard
  the new target metadata, abort the update cycle, and report the failure.

3. **Check for an arbitrary software attack**. The new targets
  <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST have been signed by a threshold
  of keys specified in the trusted root metadata file. If the new targets metadata
  file is not signed as required, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report
  the failure.

4. **Check against snapshot role's targets version**. The version
  number of the new targets <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST match
  the version number listed in the trusted snapshot metadata. If the versions do not
  match, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the failure.

5. **Check for a freeze attack**. The expiration timestamp in the
  new targets <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST be higher than the
  fixed update start time. If so, the new targets metadata file becomes the trusted
  targets metadata file. If the new targets metadata file is expired, discard it,
  abort the update cycle, and report the potential freeze attack.

6. **Persist targets metadata**. The <a href="#client">client</a> MUST
  write the file to non-volatile storage as FILENAME.EXT (e.g. targets.json).

7. **Perform a pre-order depth-first search for <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
  about the desired target, beginning with the top-level targets role.** Note: If
  any metadata requested in steps 5.6.7.1 - 5.6.7.2 cannot be downloaded nor
  validated, end the search and report that the target cannot be found.

  1. If this role has been visited before, then skip this role
    (so that cycles in the delegation graph are avoided). Otherwise, if an
    application-specific maximum number of roles have been visited, then go to
    step [[#fetch-target]] (so that attackers cannot cause the
    <a href="#client">client</a> to waste excessive bandwidth or time).
    Otherwise, if this role contains metadata about the desired target, then
    go to step [[#fetch-target]].

  2. Otherwise, recursively search the list of delegations in
     order of appearance.

    1. If the current delegation is a terminating delegation,
       then jump to step [[#fetch-target]].

    2. Otherwise, if the current delegation is a
       non-terminating delegation, continue processing the next delegation, if
       any. Stop the search, and jump to step [[#fetch-target]] as soon as a delegation
       returns a result.

## Fetch target ## {#fetch-target}

1. **Verify the desired target against its targets metadata**.

2. If there is no targets <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> about this
  <a href="#target-file">target</a>, abort the update cycle and report that
  there is no such target.

3. Otherwise, download the <a href="#target-file">target</a> (up to the number
  of bytes specified in the targets metadata), and verify that its hashes match
  the targets <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>. (We download up to this
  number of bytes, because in some cases, the exact number is unknown. This may
  happen, for example, if an external program is used to compute the root hash
  of a tree of targets files, and this program does not provide the total size
  of all of these files.) If consistent snapshots are not used (see
  [[#consistent-snapshots]]), then the filename used to download the target file
  is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT (e.g., foobar.tar.gz). Otherwise, the filename
  is of the form HASH.FILENAME.EXT (e.g.,
  c14aeb4ac9f4a8fc0d83d12482b9197452f6adf3eb710e3b1e2b79e8d14cb681.foobar.tar.gz),
  where HASH is one of the hashes of the targets file listed in the targets
  metadata file found earlier in step [[#update-targets]]. In either
  case, the <a href="#client">client</a> MUST write the file to non-volatile
  storage as FILENAME.EXT.

# Repository operations # {#repository-operations}

See [https://theupdateframework.io/](https://theupdateframework.io/) for
discussion of recommended usage in various situations.

## Key management and migration ## {#key-management-and-migration}

All keys, except those for the timestamp and mirrors roles, should be
stored securely offline (e.g. encrypted and on a separate machine, in
special-purpose hardware, etc.).  This document does not prescribe how keys
should be encrypted and stored, and so it is left to implementers of
this document to decide how best to secure them.

To replace a compromised root key or any other top-level role key, the root
role signs a new root.json file that lists the updated trusted keys for the
role.  When replacing root keys, an application will sign the new root.json
file with both the new and old root keys. Any time such a change is
required, the root.json file is versioned and accessible by version number,
e.g., 3.root.json.

<a href="#client">Clients</a> that have outdated root keys can update to
the latest set of trusted root keys, by incrementally downloading all
intermediate root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> files, and verifying
that each current version of the root metadata is signed by a threshold of
keys specified by its immediate predecessor as well as a threshold of keys
specified by itself. For example, if there is a 1.root.json that has threshold
2 and a 2.root.json that has threshold 3, 2.root.json MUST be signed by at least 2
keys defined in 1.root.json and at least 3 keys defined in 2.root.json. The
client starts the root key update process with the latest version of root
metadata available on the client, and stops when no version N+1 (where N is
the latest trusted version) of the root metadata is available from the
<a href="#repository">repository</a>. This ensures that an outdated client
can always correctly re-trace the chain of trust across multiple root key updates,
even if the latest set of root keys on the client dates back multiple root metadata
versions. See step [[#update-root]] of the client application workflow for more details.

Note that an attacker, who controls the <a href="#repository">repository</a>,
can launch freeze attacks by withholding new root metadata. The attacker does
not need to compromise root keys to do so. However, these freeze attacks are
limited by the expiration time of the latest root metadata available to the client.

To replace a delegated developer key, the role that delegated to that key
just replaces that key with another in the signed metadata where the
delegation is done.

## Consistent snapshots ## {#consistent-snapshots}

So far, we have considered a TUF <a href="#repository">repository</a> that is
relatively static (in terms of how often <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a>
and <a href="#target-file">target</a> files are updated). The problem is that if
the <a href="#repository">repository</a> (which may be a community repository
such as PyPI, RubyGems, CPAN, or SourceForge) is volatile, in the sense that the
<a href="#repository">repository</a> is continually producing new TUF metadata as
well as its targets, then should <a href="#client">clients</a> read metadata while
the same metadata is being written to, they would effectively see denial-of-service
attacks. Therefore,the <a href="#repository">repository</a> needs to be careful
about how it writes metadata and targets. The high-level idea of the solution is
that each snapshot will be contained in a so-called consistent snapshot. If a
client is reading from one consistent snapshot, then the <a href="#repository">
repository</a> is free to write another consistent snapshot without interrupting
that client.

### Writing consistent snapshots ### {#writing-consistent-snapshots}

We now explain how a <a href="#repository">repository</a> should write
<a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> and <a href="#target-file">targets</a>
to produce self-contained consistent snapshots.

Simply put, every <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file MUST be named
as such: if the file had the original name of FILENAME.EXT, then it MUST be
written to non-volatile storage as VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT, where VERSION_NUMBER
is the integer version number listed in the metadata file.

On the other hand, consistent <a href="#target-file">target files</a> MUST
be written to non-volatile storage as HASH.FILENAME.EXT. This means that if the
referrer <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> lists N cryptographic hashes of
the referred file, then there MUST be N identical copies of the referred file,
where each file will be distinguished only by the value of the digest in its
filename. The modified filename need not include the name of the cryptographic
hash function used to produce the digest because, on a read, the choice of
function follows from the selection of a digest (which includes the name of
the cryptographic function) from all digests in the referred file.

Timestamp <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> (timestamp.EXT) MUST be written
to non-volatile storage without a version prefix whenever it is updated. This is
required because timestamp metadata is the only metadata file that may be requested
without known version numbers. It is OPTIONAL for an implementation to write an
identical copy of timestamp.EXT to the respective VERSION_NUMBER.timestamp.EXT for
record-keeping purposes.

Most importantly, <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> file formats SHALL NOT be
updated to refer to the names of metadata or target files with their consistent
snapshot prefix included. In other words, if a metadata file A refers to another
metadata file B as FILENAME.EXT, then the filename listed in the metadata MUST
remain as FILENAME.EXT and not VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT. This rule is in place
so that metadata signed by roles with offline keys will not be forced to sign for the
metadata file whenever it is updated. In the next subsection, we will see how
<a href="#client">clients</a> will reproduce the name of the intended file.

Finally, when consistent snapshots are written by the <a href="#repository">
repository</a> the root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> MUST write the
boolean <a>CONSISTENT_SNAPSHOT</a> attribute at the root level of its keys of
attributes set to the true value. If consistent snapshots are not written by the
<a href="#repository">repository</a>, then the attribute MAY either be left
unspecified or be set to the false value.

Regardless of whether consistent snapshots are ever used or not, all
released versions of root <a href="#target-metadata">metadata</a> files MUST always
be provided so that outdated <a href="#client">clients</a> can update to the latest
available root.


### Reading consistent snapshots ### {#reading-consistent-snapshots}

## Adding and updating targets ##Â {#adding-updating-targets}

The following subsections describe how to update <a href="#target-metadata">
metadata</a> on the <a href="#repository">repository</a> when adding targets to
